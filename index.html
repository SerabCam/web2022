    <p>Welcome to our jumping spider care website! These small creatures are incredibly easy to take care of, and are often overlooked in many different ways! They're very smart, and are very friendly! A very good first time pet for those interested in either insect or arachnid care! I'm Sergio, the developer of the website. My girlfriend, karla, takes care of not just spiders, but also mantises as well! We both learned alot in our time keeping our new pets, and they're very easy to keep, and not at all dangerous to hold. This website should provide some simple and easy direction for the care, maintenance, and knowledge of these animals!</p>
