    <p>Jumping spiders are very easy to take care of! But that doesn't mean you can sleep on their care. There are a few things that you need to consider for some basic care of your new friend! <br /> *Make sure they have a glass or clear plastic terrarium with lots of small holes for air! <br /> *These little guys don't spin webs, but instead make web cocoons, so make sure they have enough material for a bed!<br />*Hydrate your pet by misting! they don't need a lot of water.<br />*Keep the habitat out of direct sunlight! they overheat easily.<br />*Make sure your friend is fed! they eat crickets, but make sure they're not too large, crickets can and will fight back if they think they can win!<br />*Interact with them! they need to be enriched, don't let them be bored!</p>
